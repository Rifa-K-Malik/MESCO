        family belongs to Jharkhand. She was diagnosed and treated for infantile hypotonia and delayed motor
        milestone. The condition was causing delayed developmental milestones like walking, speaking, sitting
        and other physical activities as per her age. Her mother visited the MESCO Physiotherapy Clinic in May
        2019. The primary goal was to enable and correct the condition of her lower limb, thus enabling her to
        sit with least support. Within one and half months she started sitting on her own and crawling. In the
        last four and half months Mushira has been undergoing therapy and is showing positive results. By the
        end of September, she was able to stand with minimum support and walk on her own with support. The
        change in the condition of Mushiraâ€™s health has brought happiness to her family. They are very thankful
        to MESCO." `,
